# 16ParticleAccelerator
Runs 16 particle accelerators in tangent, swapping each 1st, 4th and 2nd, 3rd back and forth repeatedly

The theory is that if there are 2 threads, 1 moving an electron from position 1 to position 2, and another moving an electron from position 2 to position 1
there will be an electron collision imminent moving the 2 electrons away from each other eventually nearing collision, creating antimatter which will
cause an gamma ray burst if made at matter site, and will cause the electrons to move forwards and backwards in time simultaneously creating an alternate
universe in which time moves backwards.
By causing a swap between collision sites brings about the posibility that the two may just cause multiversal transition. That is one electron may move
backwards and wind up following the course of of the 3rd electron backwards being repelled by the collision of the 4th, as the second electron follows
the course of the 4th electron backwards being repelled by the force of the 3rd electron
